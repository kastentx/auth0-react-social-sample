# Customizing Lock

[Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/10-customizing-lock)

This example shows how to customize the `Lock` widget. Sometimes you need to change some UI stuff so this is what we are going to do.

Much of this code was taken from the auto-created "sample app" on Auth0's site.

This is basically the React.js Single Page App version, with my API Keys and options set.
